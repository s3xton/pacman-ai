<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The final project involves a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman, where agents control both Pacman and ghosts in coordinated team-based strategies.  Your team will try to eat the food on the far side of the map, while defending the food on your home side. We'll be having a contest between student submissions and announce nightly tournament starting Sunday March 8. The final tournament will be run at 11PM Sunday March 15. 2-3 page Project writeups should be turned in by 5PM Monday March 16.

<p>We will evaluate your submissions based on a short written report (2-3 pages) on your modeling of the problem and agent design, as well as your performance against your classmates in tournament play.

<p><strong>Academic Dishonesty:</strong> While we won't grade the source code of contest submissions directly, we still expect you not to falsely represent your work.  <em>Please</em> don't let us down.

<h3>Rules of Pacman Capture the Flag</h3>

<b>Layout:</b> The Pacman map is now divided into two halves: blue (right) and red (left).  Red agents (which all have even indices) must defend the red food while trying to eat the blue food.  When on the red side, a red agent is a ghost.  When crossing into enemy territory, the agent becomes a Pacman.

<p><b>Scoring:</b>  When a Pacman eats a food dot, the food is permanently removed and one point is scored for that Pacman's team.  Red team scores are positive, while Blue team scores are negative.


<p><b>Eating Pacman:</b> When a Pacman is eaten by an opposing ghost, the Pacman returns to its starting position (as a ghost).  No points are awarded for eating an opponent.

<p><b>Power capsules:</b> If Pacman eats a power capsule, agents on the opposing team become "scared" for the next 40 moves, or until they are eaten and respawn, whichever comes sooner.  Agents that are "scared" are susceptible while in the form of ghosts (i.e. while on their own team's side) to being eaten by Pacman.  Specifically, if Pacman collides with a "scared" ghost, Pacman is unaffected and the ghost respawns at its starting position (no longer in the "scared" state).

<p><b>Observations:</b> Agents can only observe an opponent's configuration (position and direction) if they or their teammate is within 5 squares (Manhattan distance).  In addition, an agent always gets a noisy distance reading for each agent on the board, which can be used to approximately locate unobserved opponents.

<p><b>Winning:</b> A game ends when one team eats all but two of the opponents' dots.  Games are also limited to 1200 agent moves (300 moves per each of the four agents).  If this move limit is reached, whichever team has eaten the most food wins. If the score is zero (i.e., tied) this is recorded as a tie game.

<p><b>Computation Time:</b> We will run your submissions on a VM server. Each move which does not return within one second will incur a warning.  After three warnings, or any single move taking more than 3 seconds, the game is forfeit.  There will be an initial start-up allowance of 15 seconds (use the <code>registerInitialState</code> function). If you agent times out or otherwise throws an exception, an error message will be present in the log files, which you can download from the results page (see below).

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>The contest will count as your final project, worth 25 points. 20 of these points will be the result of a written report you submit with your agent describing your approach. The remaining 5 points will be awarded based on your performance in the final contest.
<p>The written report should be 2-3 pages (no more). Through this report we expect you to demonstrate your ability to constructively solve AI problems by identifying:
<ul>
<li>the fundamental problems you are trying to solve
<li>how you modeled these problems
<li>your representations of the problems
<li>the computational strategy used to solve each problem
<li>algorithmic choices you made in your implementation
<li>any obstacles you encountered while solving the problem
<li>evaluation of your agent
<li>lessons learned during the project
</ul>
<p>The performance-based portion of your grade will be awarded as follows:
<ul>
<li>2 points for a solution that runs
<li>3 points for the top 75%
<li>4 points for the top 40%
<li>5 points for the top 20%
</ul>

<h3> Submission Instructions </h3>

<p><b>VERY IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ THOROUGHLY.</b></p>

<p>To enter into the nightly tournaments, your team must be defined in <code><a href="docs/myTeam.html">myTeam.py</a></code>.  Due to the way the tournaments are run, your code must not rely on any additional files that we have not provided (The submission system may allow you to submit additional files, but the contest framework will not include them when your code is run in the tournament). You may not modify the code we provide.</p>

<p>Every team must have a unique name, consisting only of ASCII letters and digits.
(Any other characters, including whitespace, will be ignored.) Fill in your team name at the google doc
<a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cA6CWPVMsH-XaxIM9aPufDOiLuvwnzNUwbexr29z0N0/edit">here</a>.

<p>In your submission, you must include a file <code>name.txt</code> in which you specify your unique team name. Only your team name will be displayed to the rest of the class.  
<!-- Once you submit under a particular name, only you will be permitted to submit under that name, until you give up the name by either submitting under a different team name or submitting with a blank team name, which serves to remove you from the tournament.   -->

<p>To submit, use our submit server <a href="http://cmps140.soe.ucsc.edu/p5/submit.html">here</a>. Submit a zip file named solution. Zip all necessary files with the command:
<pre><small>zip solution.zip myTeam.py name.txt</small></pre>
Include additional files in the submission if you need to. Since there isn't a "correct" solution to this assignment, the submit server test will report whether your agent beat the provided <code>baseLineTeam</code> agent within the contest rules.

<p>By Monday the 16th at 5PM submit your report as a file named  "[your team name].pdf" at ecommons (there will be a P5 assignment where you will be able to submit). Please make sure that this document contains the names of all members of your team clearly stated at the top.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

By default, you can run a game with the simple <code>baselineTeam</code> that the staff has provided:


<pre>python capture.py</pre>

<p>A wealth of options are available to you:

<pre>python capture.py --help</pre>

There are four slots for agents, where agents 0 and 2 are always on the red team, and 1 and 3 are on the blue team.  Agents are created by agent factories (one for Red, one for Blue).  See the section on designing agents for a description of the agents invoked above.

The only team that we provide is the <code>baselineTeam</code>. It is chosen by default as both the red and blue team, but as an example of how to choose teams:

<pre>python capture.py -r baselineTeam -b baselineTeam</pre>

which specifies that the red team <code>-r</code> and the blue team <code>-b</code> are both created from <code><a href="docs/baselineTeam.html">baselineTeam.py</a></code>.

To control one of the four agents with the keyboard, pass the appropriate option:


<pre>python capture.py --keys0</pre>

The arrow keys control your character, which will change from ghost to Pacman when crossing the center line.

<h3>Layouts</h3>

By default, all games are run on the <code>defaultcapture</code> layout. To test your agent on other layouts, use the <code>-l</code> option.
In particular, you can generate random layouts by specifying <code>RANDOM[seed]</code>. For example, <code>-l RANDOM13</code> will use a map randomly generated with seed 13.


<h3>Game Types</h3>

You can play the game in two ways: local games, and nightly tournaments.

<p>Local games (described above) allow you to test your agents against the baseline teams we provide and are intended for use in development.


<h3><a name="tournaments">Official Tournaments</h3>

The actual competitions will be run using nightly automated tournaments on a course server, with the final tournament deciding the final contest outcome.  See the submission instructions for details of how to enter a team into the tournaments.  Tournaments are run everyday at approximately 11pm and include all teams that have been submitted (either earlier in the day or on a previous day) as of the start of the tournament.  Currently, each team plays every other team 6 times (to reduce randomness), but this may change.  The layouts used in the tournament will be drawn from both the default layouts included in the zip file as well as randomly generated layouts each night. All layouts are symmetric, and the team that moves first is randomly chosen. The results are available at <a href="http://cmps140.soe.ucsc.edu/tournament/2015-03-dd/results.html">http://cmps140.soe.ucsc.edu/tournament/2015-03-dd/results.html</a> after the tournament completes each night - you can view overall rankings and scores for each match. At the URL, substitute dd with the day of March of the tournament results you want to access. You can also download replays, the layouts used, and the stdout / stderr logs for each agent.

<h3>Designing Agents</h3>

Unlike project 2, an agent now has the more complex job of trading off offense versus defense and effectively functioning as both a ghost and a Pacman in a team setting.   Furthermore, the limited information provided to your agent will likely necessitate some probabilistic tracking (like project 4).  Finally, the added time limit of computation introduces new challenges.

<p><b>Baseline Team:</b> To kickstart your agent design, we have provided you with a team of two baseline agents, defined in <code><a href="docs/baselineTeam.html">baselineTeam.py</a></code>.  They are both quite bad.  The <code>OffensiveReflexAgent</code> moves toward the closest food on the opposing side.  The <code>DefensiveReflexAgent</code> wanders around on its own side and tries to chase down invaders it happens to see.

<p><b>File naming:</b> For the purpose of testing or running games locally, you can define a team of agents in any arbitrarily-named python file.  When submitting to the nightly tournament, however, you must define your agents in <code><a href="docs/myTeam.html">myTeam.py</a></code> (and you must also create a <code>name.txt</code> file that specifies your team name).


<p><b>Interface:</b> The <code>GameState</code> in <code><a href="docs/capture.html">capture.py</a></code> should look familiar, but contains new methods like <code>getRedFood</code>, which gets a grid of food on the red side (note that the grid is the size of the board, but is only true for cells on the red side with food).  Also, note that you can list a team's indices with <code>getRedTeamIndices</code>, or test membership with <code>isOnRedTeam</code>.

<p>Finally, you can access the list of noisy distance observations via <code>getAgentDistances</code>.  These distances are within 6 of the truth, and the noise is chosen uniformly at random from the range [-6, 6] (e.g., if the true distance is 6, then each of {0, 1, ..., 12} is chosen with probability 1/13).  You can get the likelihood of a noisy reading using <code>getDistanceProb</code>.


<p><b>Distance Calculation: </b>To facilitate agent development, we provide code in <code><a href="docs/distanceCalculator.html">distanceCalculator.py</a></code> to supply shortest path maze distances.

<p>To get started designing your own agent, we recommend subclassing the <code>CaptureAgent</code> class.  This provides access to several convenience methods.  Some useful methods are:

<pre>
  def getFood(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns the food you're meant to eat. This is in the form
    of a matrix where m[x][y]=true if there is food you can
    eat (based on your team) in that square.
    """

  def getFoodYouAreDefending(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns the food you're meant to protect (i.e., that your
    opponent is supposed to eat). This is in the form of a
    matrix where m[x][y]=true if there is food at (x,y) that
    your opponent can eat.
    """

  def getOpponents(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns agent indices of your opponents. This is the list
    of the numbers of the agents (e.g., red might be "1,3,5")
    """

  def getTeam(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns agent indices of your team. This is the list of
    the numbers of the agents (e.g., red might be "1,3,5")
    """

  def getScore(self, gameState):
    """
    Returns how much you are beating the other team by in the
    form of a number that is the difference between your score
    and the opponents score. This number is negative if you're
    losing.
    """

  def getMazeDistance(self, pos1, pos2):
    """
    Returns the distance between two points; These are calculated using the provided
    distancer object.

    If distancer.getMazeDistances() has been called, then maze distances are available.
    Otherwise, this just returns Manhattan distance.
    """

  def getPreviousObservation(self):
    """
    Returns the GameState object corresponding to the last
    state this agent saw (the observed state of the game last
    time this agent moved - this may not include all of your
    opponent's agent locations exactly).
    """

  def getCurrentObservation(self):
    """
    Returns the GameState object corresponding this agent's
    current observation (the observed state of the game - this
    may not include all of your opponent's agent locations
    exactly).
    """

  def debugDraw(self, cells, color, clear=False):
    """
    Draws a colored box on each of the cells you specify. If clear is True,
    will clear all old drawings before drawing on the specified cells.
    This is useful for debugging the locations that your code works with.

    color: list of RGB values between 0 and 1 (i.e. [1,0,0] for red)
    cells: list of game positions to draw on  (i.e. [(20,5), (3,22)])
    """


</pre>



<p><b>Restrictions:</b> You are free to design any agent you want.  However, you will need to respect the provided APIs if you want to participate in the tournaments.  Agents which compute during the opponent's turn will be disqualified. In particular, any form of multi-threading is disallowed, because we have found it very hard to ensure that no computation takes place on the opponent's turn.


<!--Because the tournament will be run using the online architecture, you can run your agent from your machine using any resources or code you want; you can even write code in different programming languages if you so desire.  Change pacclient.py at your own risk, though, because you don't want to break the network functionality. //-->

<p><b>Warning:</b> If one of your agents produces any stdout/stderr output during its games in the nightly tournaments, that output will be included in the contest results posted on the website.  Additionally, in some cases a stack trace may be shown among this output in the event that one of your agents throws an exception.  You should design your code in such a way that this does not expose any information that you wish to keep confidential.</p>

<h3>Contest Details</h3>



<p><b>Teams:</b> You may work in teams of 2-3 people.

<p><b>Prizes:</b>

Rankings are determined according to the number of points received in a nightly round-robin tournaments, where a win is worth 4 points, a tie is worth 1 point, and losses are worth 0 (Ties are not worth very much to discourage stalemates). To be included in a nightly tournament, your submission must be in by 11:00pm that night.

<p>Extra credit will be awarded according to the nightly tournament rankings as follows: we will track the top three teams in the nightly tournaments. We will award 2 extra credit points to all teams that submit two days after the assignment is released (submitted by 3/5) regardless of performance. Winners in the mid-point contest (run on 3/11) will receive 3 extra points for 1st place, 2 extra points for 2nd place, and 1 extra point for third place. Winners in the final contest (run on 3/15) will receive points as follows: 3 points for 1st place, 2 points for 2nd place, and 1 point for third place.
<!--If your team <b>ever</b> ranks in the top 10 after tracking starts, you will receive 1 additional point. If your team <b>ever</b> ranks in the top 3 after tracking starts, you will receive 1 additional point. Finally, if your team wins the final nightly tournament you will receive 1 additional point.
<p>
In addition, dastardly staff members have entered the tournament with their own devious agents, seeking fame and glory. These agents have team names beginning with Staff-. In addition to the nightly tournament extra credit, for every staff agent you <b>ever</b> defeat in a best of 9 head to head during a nightly tournament, you will receive 0.5 extra points.


<p><b>Prize Summary:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Beating Staff- agents head to head: 0.5 extra credit points on the final per agent.
  <li> Top 20 after 11/14/2011: 1 additional extra credit point on the final.
  <li> Top 10 after 11/21/2011: 1 additional point.
  <li> Top 3 after 11/28/2011: 1 additional point.
  <li> Top team on 12/1/2011: 1 additional point.
</ul>
<br/>
The earlier you submit your agents, the better your chances of earning a high ranking, and the more chances you will have to defeat the staff agents.
